# CypressAutoTest

# Booking Example: Cypress in JavaScript

This is the e2e test for booking an appointment.
It shows how to make an e2e automating test with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in JavaScript.

It uses:

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) as the programming language
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for browser automation
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/) as the local browser for testing
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management

To run this example project, you'll need:

1. An email address provider [MailSlurp](https://www.mailslurp.com/) to get verification code. 
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or higher
3. A good JavaScript editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript)
4. Up-to-date versions of the following browsers:
   * [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
   * [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
   * [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
